Dot and Boxes Game
Dot and Boxes is a classic pen-and-paper game where two players take turns connecting dots to form lines. When a player completes a box by forming the fourth side, they score a point and get another turn. The player with the most boxes at the end of the game wins.

üñ•Ô∏è Game Overview

The game has been implemented using Python and Pygame. It supports both two-player mode and single-player mode against a basic AI.

‚ú® Features

Grid-based Gameplay: The game consists of a grid where players take turns to draw lines between dots.
Two Players: The game supports two players - either two human players taking turns or one human player against an AI.
Turn-based System: The game alternates turns between the players unless a player completes a box, in which case they get an extra turn.
Score Tracking: Keep track of each player's score throughout the game.
Single-player Mode: Play against a basic AI that makes random moves.

üéÆ Instructions for Playing
Player 1 is represented by 'X' (Blue) and Player 2 (or AI) is represented by 'O' (Green).
Controls:
 Use the mouse to draw lines by clicking near the sides of the boxes.
Restart Game: Press the 'R' key to restart the game.
Quit Game: Press 'Q' or the 'Escape' key to quit the game.

Steps to Play
Drawing Lines:
Click near the top, right, bottom, or left side of a cell to draw the corresponding line.
Completing Boxes:
When you complete a box, it will be filled with your color (Blue for 'X', Green for 'O'), and you will get an additional turn.
AI Moves:
If playing in single-player mode, the AI will automatically make its move after your turn.
Winning the Game:
The game ends when all boxes are completed. The player with the most boxes wins.
